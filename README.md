#This is breast cancer detection project done using Ml,pandas, matplotlib
## The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).
##Completed the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning 
### Build classification models(DecisionTree,LogisticRegression,ReinForest,XGboost,SVM)  to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
### Understanding the Dataset & cleanup is done.
